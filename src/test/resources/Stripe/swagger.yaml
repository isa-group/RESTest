          Suppose this was converted into 12.34 USD in your Stripe account. Then the
          BalanceTransaction's `amount` would be `1234`, `currency` would be `usd`,

          For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isn’t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.

          For external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.

      Once payment is successful, the Checkout Session will contain a reference
      to the [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers), and either the successful
      [PaymentIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) or an active
      [Subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).

      You can create a Checkout Session on your server and pass its ID to the
      client to begin Checkout.

  event:
    description: |-
      Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
      your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
      object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
      event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
      `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
      events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
      customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
      `charge.succeeded` event.

      Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
      resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
      example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
      `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.

      As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
      [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
      from the API. We also have a separate
      [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
      `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
      in your
      [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks'),
      and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.

      When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
      events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
      additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.

      **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is
      guaranteed only for 30 days.

      `Exchange Rate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is

      know the current rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user
      with a default payment in a foreign currency).

      If you want a guarantee that the charge is made with a certain exchange rate
      you expect is current, you can pass in `exchange_rate` to charges endpoints.
      If the value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please

  invoice:
    description: |-
      Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
      generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.

      They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
      that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).

      If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
      Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
      that finalizing the invoice,
      [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does
      not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
      until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
      webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
      connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
      creation to finalize the invoice.

      If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
      [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic'),
      Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
      emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

      Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
      amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
      charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
      per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
      invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
      customer's running account balance which is applied to the next invoice.

      More details on the customer's account balance are
      [here](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/object#customer_object-account_balance).

    description: |-
      A PaymentIntent guides you through the process of collecting a payment from your customer.
      We recommend that you create exactly one PaymentIntent for each order or
      customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
      see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

      A PaymentIntent transitions through
      [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
      throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
      authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

      Related guide: [Payment Intents API](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-intents).
    properties:

          (e.g., 100 cents to charge $1.00 or 100 to charge ¥100, a zero-decimal currency).
          The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).
          The amount value supports up to eight digits (e.g., a value of 99999999
          for a USD charge of $999,999.99).

For example, if your customer is impacted by [SCA](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication), using `off_session` will ensure that they are authenticated while processing this PaymentIntent. You will then be able to collect [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/cards/charging-saved-cards#off-session-payments-with-saved-cards) for this customer.

    description: |-
      A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
      For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
      Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

      Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
      Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
      The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
      you through the setup process.

      Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
      For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
      [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
      in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).

      By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
      even as regulations change over time.

          transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal state, the open

  token:
    description: |-
      Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
      account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
      your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
      returned to your server to use. You should use our
      [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
      client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
      and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

      If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
      the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
      your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
      that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
      client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
      Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.

      Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
      information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
      objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that
      [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
      supports only integrations that use client-side tokenization.

      [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect) platforms can reverse transfers made to a
      connected account, either entirely or partially, and can also specify whether
      to refund any related application fees. Transfer reversals add to the
      platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.

      Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
      charge](/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
      the charge. It is possible to reverse a
      [transfer_group](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/charges-transfers#transfer-options)
      transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
      reversal.
