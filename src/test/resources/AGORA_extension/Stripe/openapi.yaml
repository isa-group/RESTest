        Products describe the specific goods or services you offer to your customers.
        For example, you might offer a Standard and Premium version of your goods or service; each version would be a separate Product.
        They can be used in conjunction with [Prices](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices) to configure pricing in Checkout and Subscriptions.
