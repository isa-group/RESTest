      summary: Search for DHL Service Point locations by address.
      description: 'This method will find DHL locations based on an address by first
        converting the address to a reference point (latitude, longitude) and then
        finding locations near that point. To convert an address to a reference point,
        this API uses the ``Google Geocoding API Address``. To optimize results, besides
        ``countryCode`` you need to provide ``addressLocality`` and /or ``postalCode``.
        The more address fields you provide, the better results you may get.  Please
        read Google Geocoding API Terms of Use: <https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms>  ``Limitations:``
        Address fields are not filters. 3rd party Geocoding API hence limited control
        over results.'
