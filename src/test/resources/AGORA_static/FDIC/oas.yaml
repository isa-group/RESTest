                                by its depositors. A mutual does not issue capital stock.

                              description: >-
                                The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal
                                Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S
                                corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to
                                indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an
                                election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar
                                requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements
                                to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more
                                than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock.
                                (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and
                                certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable
                                organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must
                                consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must
                                use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the
                                reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad
                                debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had
                                been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific
                                charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate
                                allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the
                                financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are
                                subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market
                                value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on
                                the date of conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are
                                required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of
                                each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net
                                income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax
                                assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to
                                Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax
                                and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A
                                Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity,
                                similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is
                                generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate
                                level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in
                                proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally
                                pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This
                                can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax
                                expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..   The election of
                                Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders'
                                personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically
                                increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to
                                compensate for higher personal taxes.
