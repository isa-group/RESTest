        <p>You can create coupons easily via the <a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/coupons">coupon management</a> page of the Stripe dashboard. Coupon creation is also accessible via the API if you need to create coupons on the fly.</p>

        <p>A coupon has either a <code>percent_off</code> or an <code>amount_off</code> and <code>currency</code>. If you set an <code>amount_off</code>, that amount will be subtracted from any invoiceâ€™s subtotal. For example, an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>100</currency> will have a final total of <currency>0</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it and an invoice with a subtotal of <currency>300</currency> will have a final total of <currency>100</currency> if a coupon with an <code>amount_off</code> of <amount>200</amount> is applied to it.</p>

            For bank accounts, possible values are `new`, `validated`, `verified`, `verification_failed`, or `errored`. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is `new`. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be `validated`. Note that there often isnâ€™t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be `verified`. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be `verification_failed`. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to `errored` and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.

            For external accounts, possible values are `new` and `errored`. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to `errored` and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.

        The Billing customer portal is a Stripe-hosted UI for subscription and
        billing management.

        A portal configuration describes the functionality and features that you
        want to provide to your customers through the portal.

        A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for
        a particular customer. By visiting the session's URL, the customer
        can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons,
        sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL.
        Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions
        and billing details.

        A Checkout Session represents your customer's session as they pay for
        one-time purchases or subscriptions through [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout).
        We recommend creating a new Session each time your customer attempts to pay.

        Once payment is successful, the Checkout Session will contain a reference
        to the [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers), and either the successful
        [PaymentIntent](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_intents) or an active
        [Subscription](https://stripe.com/docs/api/subscriptions).

        You can create a Checkout Session on your server and pass its ID to the
        client to begin Checkout.

    event:
      description: |-
        Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in
        your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event`
        object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded`
        event; and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
        `invoice.payment_failed` event. Note that many API requests may cause multiple
        events to be created. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
        customer, you will receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
        `charge.succeeded` event.

        Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The state of that
        resource at the time of the change is embedded in the event's data field. For
        example, a `charge.succeeded` event will contain a charge, and an
        `invoice.payment_failed` event will contain an invoice.

        As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an
        [individual event](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://stripe.com/docs/api#list_events)
        from the API. We also have a separate
        [webhooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook) system for sending the
        `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. Webhooks are managed
        in your
        [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks),
        and our [Using Webhooks](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) guide will help you get set up.

        When using [Connect](https://stripe.com/docs/connect), you can also receive notifications of
        events that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there will be an
        additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.

        **NOTE:** Right now, access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#retrieve_event) is
        guaranteed only for 30 days.

        `Exchange Rate` objects allow you to determine the rates that Stripe is
        currently using to convert from one currency to another. Since this number is
        variable throughout the day, there are various reasons why you might want to
        know the current rate (for example, to dynamically price an item for a user
        with a default payment in a foreign currency).

        If you want a guarantee that the charge is made with a certain exchange rate
        you expect is current, you can pass in `exchange_rate` to charges endpoints.
        If the value is no longer up to date, the charge won't go through. Please

        A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user.
        The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options`
        parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the
        appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.

        Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as
        reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://stripe.com/docs/api/files)
        API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the
        [VerificationSession](https://stripe.com/docs/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.

        of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what [verification
        check](/docs/identity/verification-checks) to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for
        each verification in your system.

        A VerificationSession transitions through [multiple

        the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the userâ€™s verified data after
        verification checks are complete.

    invoice:
      description: |-
        Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
        generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.

        They contain [invoice items](https://stripe.com/docs/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
        that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).

        If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
        Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
        that finalizing the invoice,
        [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/invoices/workflow/#auto_advance), does
        not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
        until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
        webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
        connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
        creation to finalize the invoice.

        If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
        [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
        Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
        emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.

        Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
        amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
        charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
        per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
        invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
        customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

        More details on the customer's credit balance are
        [here](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/customer/balance).

        Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually
        charge or credit the customer's card only at the end of a regular billing
        cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize
        per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing
        totals.

        customer session in your system. You can reference the PaymentIntent later to
        see the history of payment attempts for a particular session.

        A PaymentIntent transitions through
        [multiple statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses)
        throughout its lifetime as it interfaces with Stripe.js to perform
        authentication flows and ultimately creates at most one successful charge.

The minimum amount is $0.50 US or [equivalent in charge currency](https://stripe.com/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts).

            Providing this parameter will [attach the payment method](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/save-during-payment) to the PaymentIntent's Customer, if present, after the PaymentIntent is confirmed and any required actions from the user are complete. If no Customer was provided, the payment method can still be [attached](https://stripe.com/docs/api/payment_methods/attach) to a Customer after the transaction completes.

            When processing card payments, Stripe also uses `setup_future_usage` to dynamically optimize your payment flow and comply with regional legislation and network rules, such as [SCA](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication).

        You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](https://stripe.com/docs/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.

        Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products.
        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, â‚¬9/month, and â‚¬90/year.

        Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products.
        [Products](https://stripe.com/docs/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.

        For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and â‚¬9 once.

        SetupAttempts to inspect details of a specific attempt at setting up a
        payment method using a SetupIntent.

    setup_intent:
      description: |-
        A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
        For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
        Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.

        Create a SetupIntent as soon as you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
        Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
        The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
        you through the setup process.

        Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
        For example, cardholders in [certain regions](/guides/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
        [Strong Customer Authentication](https://stripe.com/docs/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
        in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/setup-intents).
        If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
        it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
        We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
        PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.

        By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
        even as regulations change over time.

        `Source` objects allow you to accept a variety of payment methods. They
        represent a customer's payment instrument, and can be used with the Stripe API
        just like a `Card` object: once chargeable, they can be charged, or can be
        attached to customers.

            Possible values are `incomplete`, `incomplete_expired`, `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `canceled`, or `unpaid`. 

            For `collection_method=charge_automatically` a subscription moves into `incomplete` if the initial payment attempt fails. A subscription in this state can only have metadata and default_source updated. Once the first invoice is paid, the subscription moves into an `active` state. If the first invoice is not paid within 23 hours, the subscription transitions to `incomplete_expired`. This is a terminal state, the open invoice will be voided and no further invoices will be generated. 

            A subscription that is currently in a trial period is `trialing` and moves to `active` when the trial period is over. 

            If subscription `collection_method=charge_automatically` it becomes `past_due` when payment to renew it fails and `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings) when Stripe has exhausted all payment retry attempts. 

            If subscription `collection_method=send_invoice` it becomes `past_due` when its invoice is not paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.

    token:
      description: |-
        Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
        account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from
        your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is
        returned to your server to use. You should use our
        [recommended payments integrations](https://stripe.com/docs/payments) to perform this process
        client-side. This ensures that no sensitive card data touches your server,
        and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.

        If you cannot use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using
        the API with either your publishable or secret API key. Keep in mind that if
        your integration uses this method, you are responsible for any PCI compliance
        that may be required, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with
        client-side tokenization, your customer's information is not sent directly to
        Stripe, so we cannot determine how it is handled or stored.

        Tokens cannot be stored or used more than once. To store card or bank account
        information for later use, you can create [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#customers)
        objects or [Custom accounts](https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts). Note that
        [Radar](https://stripe.com/docs/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection,
        performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

        platform's balance and subtract from the destination account's balance.

        Reversing a transfer that was made for a [destination
        charge](/docs/connect/destination-charges) is allowed only up to the amount of
        the charge. It is possible to reverse a

        transfer only if the destination account has enough balance to cover the
        reversal.
