          description: "Optional. Suggestion to the search algorithm that the results be sorted by one of the these modes: best_match, rating, review_count or distance. The default is best_match. Note that specifying the sort_by is a suggestion (not strictly enforced) to Yelp's search, which considers multiple input parameters to return the most relevant results. For example, the rating sort is not strictly sorted by the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of ratings, similar to a Bayesian average. This is to prevent skewing results to businesses with a single review."
