        title: Subchapter S Corporations
        description: >-
          The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal
          Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S
          corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to
          indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an
          election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar
          requirement as of March 1998.  The most important IRS requirements
          to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more
          than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock.
          (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and
          certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable
          organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must
          consent.  Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must
          use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the
          reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad
          debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had
          been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific
          charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate
          allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the
          financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are
          subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market
          value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on
          the date of conversion to Subchapter S status.     [Banks are
          required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of
          each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net
          income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax
          assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to
          Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax
          and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.].   A
          Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity,
          similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is
          generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate
          level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in
          proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally
          pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This
          can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax
          expense and increasing their after-tax earnings..   The election of
          Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders'
          personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically
          increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to
          compensate for higher personal taxes.
