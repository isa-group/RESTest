      description: >
        Get a QueryResult object containing station objects from the database
        applying to the parameters described below.


        QueryResult is a container providing the following information about the
        query result.
          1. the total number of hits
          2. the maximum number of hits to be returned in that QueryResult object
          3. the offset of the first hit returned in that QueryResult object with respect to all hits returned by the query
          4. the result objects

        The parameters described below work as filters to reduce the number of
        hits returned. Some of these parameters must be used only once, others
        are allowed to be used multiple times. Valid parameters that are allowed
        to be used only once are _offset_, _limit_ and _logicaloperator_.


        All other parameters described below may be used multiple times.


        If a parameter is given more than once, the result will contain all hits
        that match all given parameter values.


        E.g. _federalstate=berlin&federalstate=saarland_ returns all stations in
        Berlin and Saarland.


        If more than one filter criterion is used at the same time, the
        different filter criteria are interpreted as if they are combined by a
        logical AND operator, unless the parameter _logicaloperator_ is set to
        _or_.


        E.g. _category=1-2&federalstate=hamburg_ returns all stations in Hamburg
        having category 1 or 2.


        _category=1-2&federalstate=hamburg&federalsate=hessen_ returns all
        stations in Hamburg and Hessen having category 1 or 2, while


        _searchstring=berlin*&federalstate=hamburg&federalsate=hessen&logicaloperator=or_
        will return all stations with a name starting with 'berlin' as well as
        all stations in Hamburg and Hessen.


        If no 'limit' parameter is given, the number of hits (stations) is set
        to its maximum value of 10000.


        To specify parameter values containing German umlauts, the following
        encoding has to be used
          * ä  => %C3%A4
          * ö  => %C3%B6
          * ü  => %C3%BC
          * Ä  => %C3%84
          * Ö  => %C3%96
